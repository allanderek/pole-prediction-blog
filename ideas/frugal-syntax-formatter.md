title: "Frugal syntax formatter"

* Elm has famously frugal syntax
* One benefit is that tools **other** than the compiler can be made simpler.
* Eg *elm-format*
* Example with the expression before the `|` in record update expressions.
* In general more a more complicated grammar presents more possibilities to disagree about formatting.
