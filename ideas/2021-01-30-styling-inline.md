In Elm, and any other means of dynamically creating HTML, there are essentially two means with which you can apply styling to your HTML elements. You can apply the styles *inline*, or you can simply give your elements appropriate classes and then use CSS (perhaps generated from elm-css, or using something like sass), to give style to those elements. In this post I'm going to try to write down some of the pros and cons of either approach.
